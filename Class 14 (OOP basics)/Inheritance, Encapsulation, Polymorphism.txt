Inheritance:
------------

Inheritance is a way of creating new class for using details of existing class without modifying it.
The newly formed class is a derived class (or child class). Similarly, the existing class is a base
class (or parent class).


Encapsulation:
--------------

Using OOP in Python, we can restrict access to methods and variables. This prevent data from direct
modification which is called encapsulation. In Python, we denote private attribute using underscore
as prefix i.e single “ _ “ or double “ __“.


Polymorphism:
-------------

Polymorphism is an ability (in OOP) to use common interface for multiple form (data types).
Suppose, we need to color a shape, there are multiple shape option (rectangle, square, circle).
However we could use same method to color any shape. This concept is called Polymorphism.
